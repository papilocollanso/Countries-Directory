    <p>So we wanted to help individuals find most common informations about most countries if not all countries of the world.
    So we came up with the idea of creating this Countries Directory web application which is very responsive and can be used across all devices. To help solve that problem.
    </p>
    <p>Countries are grouped according to Regions. Before you search make sure you have selected a region or all regions to be able to get the informations
    displayed properly on your screen. Just with a finger tip you have all informations staring at you. Sounds Great yeah!
